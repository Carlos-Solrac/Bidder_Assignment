# Database Encryption and Secure Messaging

**Author:** Carlos Cuellar
**Date:** 10/22/22


## About this Project

This project is designed to demonstrate the encryption of data stored in a database using third-party Python libraries, SQLlite3, discussed in the course. The encrypted data is used to send secure messages with HMAC authentication to a Python-created server. The primary goals of this project are as follows:

1. **Database Encryption:** Implement data encryption techniques to protect sensitive information stored in a database.

2. **Secure Messaging:** Develop a secure communication system that uses HMAC authentication to ensure the integrity of messages sent to a Python server.

## Assumptions

This project assumes correct input and focuses on the implementation of encryption and secure messaging features.

## Implementation Details

### Database Encryption

- The project utilizes SQLite to create and manage a database.
- Sensitive data such as bidder names, phone numbers, and login passwords are encrypted using third-party encryption libraries.

### Secure Messaging

- The program demonstrates the use of HMAC authentication to verify the integrity of messages sent to a Python server.
- The implementation ensures secure communication between clients and the server.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use your program, including any setup or configuration steps required.
